🧠 Mental Health Burnout Analyzer

An AI-based Mental Health Burnout Analyzer designed to identify potential burnout levels using data-driven and machine learning techniques.
This project focuses on early burnout detection to promote awareness and healthier mental well-being.

📌 Project Overview

The Mental Health Burnout Analyzer evaluates behavioral, emotional, and workload-related indicators to estimate burnout risk.
It demonstrates how machine learning can support mental health awareness tools through structured analysis and prediction.

⚠️ This tool is not a medical diagnostic system.
